# GoogleTimer

## How to access?

The widget [lives here](https://google-timer.slime.systems/).
Hosted by GitHub Pages, bookmarking is a good idea; the domain is somewhat hard to remember.

## What is it?

Google's timer is a widget written by Google; normally, you can access it by [googling "timer"](https://www.google.com/search?q=timer).
GoogleTimer, the project you are looking at, is the ripping of Google's timer out of Google.

## Why?

I use the widget regularly and like it very much, but [that one time](https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/1/23286876/google-built-in-timer-stopwatch-disappeared-broken-bug) Google pulled the plug by mistake, making it inaccessible for an extended period.
I wonder if I can rip the widget and host it elsewhere, and here we go. Chrome would do most of the work; I patch some code to prevent errors, and it runs.

## Benefits

* This can be a backup when we cannot access the official one.
* Clutter-free experience; just the widget, no fluff.

## License

Google owns Google's timer; I believe I can host it under fair use. If they mind, they probably will send their legal team after this repository. I don't think that is the case, though.
